# Project Name: Residential Water Quality Sensor Project (temptative)

## Motivation (i.e. problem we are trying to solve)

(to frame better)
Lead affectime residential homes 

## Idea (i.e. our solution to the problem)
Place a sensor on water tanks (for example on toilet tanks)
Use a cheap distribution network

## Requirements

### Technology requirements

-Lead Sensors
- cheap network connection

### Human Resorces
Resources to distribute the sensors and distribute educational material to raise awareness on the problem





Initial use case - lead sensing in residences

Continuous testing

Low power

Wireless

cheap






# Passive Lead Sensing

## Purpose

No safe level of lead content in water.

Monitor for lead content in water sources at the point of use. By placing a sensor in a toilet tank, the sensor will have a fresh tank of water to sample with every flush.




## Architecture

Sensor -> LoRaWAN -> TTN -> Node-red, grafana, mapbox

Generate power from movement of water.


## Sensor Research

UMich developed a $20 sensor
